A catering company has hired you to help with organizing and preparing customer's orders. You are given a list of each customer's desired items, and must write a program that will count the number of each items needed for the chefs to prepare. The items that a customer can order are: salad, hamburger, and water.

Write a function called item_order that takes as input a string named order. The string contains only words for the items the customer can order separated by one space. The function returns a string that counts the number of each item and consolidates them in the following order: salad:[# salad] hamburger:[# hambruger] water:[# water]

If an order does not contain an item, then the count for that item is 0. Notice that each item is formatted as [name of the item][a colon symbol][count of the item] and all item groups are separated by a space.

For example:

If order = "salad water hamburger salad hamburger" then the function returns "salad:2 hamburger:2 water:1"
If order = "hamburger water hamburger" then the function returns "salad:0 hamburger:2 water:1"
